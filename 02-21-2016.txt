Meeting 2-21-16
    Work Session
        Redesigned graphs
            Overall graph
                has 6 key options - Overall, Temp, Turbidity, Conductivity, pH, Total Water Usage
                only show 1 line at a time
                y-axis will change dynamically with which variable you have selected
                underneath will be a range selecter for the date ranges you are interested in
                user will be able to select a single day
            Point graphs (these desplay visualizations for each data point selected in the above graph)
                Date
                    Current selected date will be written as text
                Temp
                    a verticle bar graph/thermometer will be visible indicating the temp
                Turbidity
                    a circle that will have the value written in the center
                    The color of the circle will match the expected color of the water
                Conductivity
                    a pi chart with the value written in the slice (0.5,0.25,etc), the other section will be clear
                pH
                    a horizontal bar graph that will show the current pH (written as well as deducible from axis)
                Total Water Usage
                    a bar graph that will display the usage of water across the day
                    x-axis -> time (8 am, 10 am, etc)
                    y-axis -> amount used (gallons?)
            Additional graphs
                Water quality v. water usage
                    x-axis -> water quality
                    y-axis -> water usage
        Future graphs/features
            add average daily water consumption on entire selcted range (can add a switch to water usage point graph)
