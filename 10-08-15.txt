        Lillyan
            Node.js
                best for building fast scalable network applications
                package manager
                huge computation is bad
                process files while updating
                good for dashboards
                bad for relational data, large computation
            Demo: Frontend (bootstrap v Skeleton)
                BootStrap
                    tons of pre-written css
                    gives you a bunch of options
                Skeleton
                    400 lines of css written
                    easy to use
                    same as boot strap, but less things to use
                Bottomline: use bootstrap because it has a greater library
        Annie
            Ruby on Rails
                made a small user/email app
            Demo: Database (MongoDB)
                RESOURCE: mongoDB university 
                    for node.js
                    for general devs
                    etc.
        Frank
            Ruby on Rails
                same as annie
            Mean stack
                partway -
        Erin
            Ruby v Node.js
                ruby gives more out of the box
                ruby, you have to learn rails, but way faster
                js easy to pickup, but less build-in functions
                Rails in the better choice
            DC.js
                there's a book
                resources
                DC.js
                all the basics of D3.js
            Bottomline: use Ruby, DC.js
