        Discussed new graphs (see picture)
            Main graph
                data time line with history
                displays 0-100 water quality score
                can select a variable (temp, turbidity, pH, conductivity, usage) to view
                    axis should change
            Under main graph (4 smaller graph depicting the actaul value)
                1. temp -> thermometer graph
                2. turbidity -> circle with score and color of water
                3. pH -> line pH scale
                4. conductivity -> pi graph 0-1.0
            Under those (usage graphs)
                1. avg usage at time of day
                2. usage x quality
