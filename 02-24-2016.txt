Meeting 2-24-16
    Website Layout and design with guest star Theresa
        Lillyan
            drew the current layout
            explained the different features to Theresa
                section1 - water quality
                    Overall graph (1 line, 5 selectors, data time range underneath)
                        Overall (0-100 scaled values, overall water quality v. time)
                        pH (0-12ish, pH v. time)
                        conductivity (0.0-1.0, conductivity v. time)
                        Temperature (dependent, temp. v. time)
                        Turbidity (dependent, turbidity v. time)
                    Sub graphs (below overall graph, allow user to select a point on overall graoh and break down variable values)
                        pH
                            pH meter
                            color may vary with safe/unsafe bounds
                        Temp
                            singe bar graph
                            color may vary with temp
                        Conductivity
                            pichart that is like a thin line going around in circle
                            color varies with safe/unsafe
                        Tubidity
                            circle filled with a single color
                            may have waves to denote water (in this case only water is filled
                            color varies with the percieved color of the water
                section2 - Local Water Usage
                    Water Quality v. Water Usage
                        line graph
                        data time range selector, like above overall graph, underneath
                    Daily usage (displayed usage over a day)
                        historgraph
                        x-axis: 8-10 am, 10-12, etc. (time)
                        y-axis: how much water taken from well during time range
                        data will be the date selected from overall or water usage (they will be linked)
                        ranges can only be selected in single day intervals
                section3 - contact, get email notifications, export data
                        input section for email, to receive notifications on water quality status
                        contact info to learn more
                        export data options
        Design Review Presentation outline
            introduction of purpose and goal of web app
            intended user base and needs
            how have we converted those needs into functionalities
            introduce graph design (basic lay out, grid like)
                water quality section
                water usage section
                contacts/data/more
            Demo of current graphs
            Questions
